# Workplace Management System

This is an ASP.NET Core 6 MVC web application that allows users to create an account and access the workplace management system. By default, new accounts are assigned an employee role and are given limited access. Users with administrator accounts are given full access and can give administrator access to new users. This application allows a user to create, update, and delete employee information, tasks, rewards, and roles. In addition, users can leave their feedback by filling out and submitting a form. The workplace management system has been deployed to the web and it can be accessed with the link below.
